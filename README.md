# GetaTest

This is the part 2 of the test task for Geta.

I have used Angular Cli since it is a fast way of egnerating a project.

The app displays top 50 music tracks in Latvia from Last.fm

The data is received using Last.fm API.

Notes:

- Single module (since this is a test task)
- rxjs Observable used for data update
- Bootstrap styles applied
- Model for Track is described in track.ts
- No routing (since this is a test task)


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
